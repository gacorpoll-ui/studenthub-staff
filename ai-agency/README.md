# StudentHub AI Agency

A structured AI agency setup with the following teams, each composed of 6 specialized agents:

- Project Commander
- Engineering
- Desain
- Marketing
- Testing
- Research
- Product
- Strategi

## Folder contents

- `agents.json` — team and agent definitions for the agency

## How to use

1. Open `ai-agency/agents.json`.
2. Adapt team and agent names for your project.
3. Use this manifest as a starting point for building AI assistants, agency workflows, or a multi-agent platform.

## Example usage

- Assign `Project Commander` agents for planning and delivery oversight.
- Use `Engineering` agents to define development roles and implementation tasks.
- Use `Desain` agents to support UX/UI, brand, and accessibility.
- Use `Marketing` agents to create launch campaigns and growth initiatives.
- Use `Testing` agents to validate quality across functional, performance, and security dimensions.
- Use `Research` agents to gather user insights, market data, and innovation signals.
- Use `Product` agents to maintain the roadmap, prioritize features, and measure product outcomes.
- Use `Strategi` agents to guide business direction, pricing, partnerships, and sustainable growth.

## Next step

If you want, I can also create a GitHub branch and push this agency setup to the remote repository.

## Run the AI agency CLI

This project now includes a small AI agency runtime that can inspect your GitHub profile, search opportunities, and generate README suggestions.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set your environment variables:

```bash
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "your_token_here"
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_openai_key"
```

3. Run the CLI:

```bash
npm run ai-agency -- preview
npm run ai-agency -- profile
npm run ai-agency -- search "hiring remote javascript"
npm run ai-agency -- suggest-readme
npm run ai-agency -- create-issue owner/repo "Title" "Issue body"
```

## What this does

- `preview` prints the current agency structure
- `profile` reads your GitHub profile with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `search` scans GitHub issues for hiring/opportunity keywords
- `suggest-readme` generates improvement suggestions using OpenAI
- `create-issue` opens a new issue in a chosen repo

## Run the AI agency preview

This agency manifest is currently a design blueprint. To inspect it locally, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run run:ai-agency
```

This will print the agency name, team list, and each agent's focus from `ai-agency/agents.json`.
